# React Assignment

## Overview

To complete this assignment, you will need to write a simple [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) based web app, and provide us the source files to be built.

The purpose of this assignment is to assess your **skills and approach to composing a simple web app** given a set of screens and an API feed. We will also assess the **generated HTML, CSS, and JS** output.

This assignment is expected to take about 2-5 hours.

## Assignment

It's pretty simple. Using the provided screens as a reference, you'll need to build a set of React components to render the app. You'll also need to request a JSON feed, filter that data, and use the relevant fields.

Although this is a basic exercise, we'll be looking for **simple, well-designed, performant, and tested code** in the submission.

## Details

You will need to build the following 3 pages with React:

- A "Home" page
- A "Series" page
- A "Movies" page

Please create components for each part of the page (eg. header, content, footer, etc).
Assets are provided in the `assets` folder.

The pages should also be usable on mobile and tablet devices.

You can assume that you do not have to support legacy browsers without features such as `fetch` or `flexbox`.

### "Home" Page

Refer to the [screens/1-home.jpg](./screens/1-home.jpg) screen.

This will be your `index.html` screen.

You will need to display 2 tiles, which link to the "Series" page and the "Movies" page.

### "Series" and "Movies" Pages

Refer to the [screens/2-series.jpg](./screens/2-series.jpg) and [screens/3-movies.jpg](./screens/3-movies.jpg) screens.

For each page you will need to fetch this JSON feed [feed/sample.json](provided in feed/sample.json), then:

- Display the first 21 `entries`
- Where the entry has a `releaseYear` attribute value >= `2010`
- Sorted by the `title` attribute value in ascending alphanumeric order

For the "Series" page filter on:

- Where the entry has a `programType` attribute value of `series`

For the "Movies" page filter on:

- Where the entry has a `programType` attribute value of `movie`

The attributes you should use to display the entries are:

- `title`
- `images` → `Poster Art` → `url`

You will also need to handle the loading and error states of fetching the JSON feed:

- "Loading" state [screens/1.1-loading.jpg](./screens/1.1-loading.jpg)
- "Error" state [screens/1.2-error.jpg](./screens/1.2-error.jpg)
